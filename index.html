Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on Octomber 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat India. He was a pivotal figure
in India's struggle for independence from British rule. He led the fight for freedom through his philosophy of 
non-violence and truth, known as Satyagraha. Gandhi's influence extended beyond India, inspiring movements for civil 
rights and equality worldwide.

Gandhiji studied law in England and later practiced in South  Africa, where he  faced racial discrimination.
This experience fueled his commitment to non-violent resistance and his later advocacy for civil rights.
Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and became a leader in the Indian National Cogress.
He advocated for non-violent resistance to British rule, organizing movements like the Civil Disobedience Movement 
and the Salt March.
<br>
<br>
Mahatma Gandhi's leadership was very crucial in achieving India's independence in 1947.
Mahatma Gandhi's first nationalwide Satyagraha was too late to influence the framing of the new Government of 
India Act of 1919, the magnitude of disorder resulting from the movement was unparalleled and presented a new 
challenge to foreign rule.
His popularity soared  in Indian politics as he reached the hearts and minds of ordinary people,
winning support for his causes as no one else had ever done before. Emerging leaders within the Congress--
Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel , Rajedra Prasad, C. Rajagopalachari- accepted Gandhi's leadership in 
articulating nationalist aspirations but disagreed on strategies for wresting more concessions from the British. 
<br>
<br>

Mahatma Gandhi reemerged from his long seclusion by undertaking his most inspired campaign ,a march  of about 400 Kilometers
from his commune in Ahmadabad to Dandi , on the coast of Gujarat between March 12 and April 6,1930. At 
dandi , in protest against extortionate British taxes on salt, he and thousands of followers illegally but symbolically
made their own salt from sea water.
